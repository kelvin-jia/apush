# APUSH
This repository is a collection of my notes taken in 2024-25 uploaded to Github for portability.

## Types of notes
- **Eras**: the gist of major time periods, like events, people, causation and continuity, etc. It also acts as a nice index to everything.
- **People**: biographical notes of significant figures, which lists their occupation and, if available, works.
- **Events**: chronological events that greatly affect history with causes and effects.
- **Entities**: participating social, economical, or political groups with ideologies and goals.
- **Documents**: important papers like treaties and constitutional drafts.
- **Policies**: domestic or foreign legislations or ideologies.
- **Concepts**: important definitions that used by historians.

## Purpose
The reason I shifted from taking notes chronologically to hybriding it with concepts was to utilize the Atomic Notes system, where each idea has a page that can be referenced to. This is not only extra helpful in saving my time trying to link stuff together, but also extremely efficient as I can review small but detailed notes on one specific topic instead of having to read the monolith of a class lecture.
