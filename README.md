# APUSH Notes
This repository is a collection of my AP US history notes taken in 2024-25.

## Types of notes
- **Timelines**: hierarchical notes that list the gist of eras, like major events, people, causation and continuity, etc.
- **People**: notes that record significant figures biographically, which lists their occupation and, if available, works.
