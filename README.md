# APUSH Notes
This repository is a collection of my AP US history notes taken in 2024-25.

## Types of notes
- **Timelines**: the gist of eras, like major events, people, causation and continuity, etc.
- **People**: biographical notes of significant figures, which lists their occupation and, if available, works.
- **Events**: chronological events that greatly affect history with causes and effects.
- **Entities**: participating social, economical, or political groups with ideologies and goals.
