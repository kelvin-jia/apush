# Stock Market Crash
- **Black Tuesday**, day of the Stock Market Crash
- Panic Selling
    - Less stocks being sold and price goes down
    - Everyone sells stocks
    - Banks call in loans
    - People cannot repay and banks die
    - DJIA pluging 11% in heavy trading
## Causes
- Buying on margin
    - Buying stocks with loan
    - People owe money to their brokers
    - Banks rapidly lost money
- Overspeculation on loans
    - Many assumed unlimited stock increase
    - Optimism on repaying loans
    - Installment buying
        - Basically interests but for products
- Overproduction
    - Starts with farms and factories
        - **Parity**, the government pays farmers to compensate production costs, did not work
    1. Businesses cut production which dominoes into other industries
    2. Workers suffer from layoffs or wage cuts
    3. No buying stuff womp womp
    4. No demands for businesses
