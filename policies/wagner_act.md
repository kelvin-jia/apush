- Most important US labor legislation of the 20th century
- Replaced the declared unconstitutional *National Labor Recovery Act* with bolder conditions:
    - Right of workers to collective bargain and join unions
    - Outlawed unfair labor practices
    - Established National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to enforce the law and protect rights
- Constitutionality questioned but upheld
